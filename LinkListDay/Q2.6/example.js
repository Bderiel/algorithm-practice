/* implement palindrome : how to 
let str = 'jose'
let norm = '';
let rev = '';
for(let i =0;i<str.length;i++){
  norm += str[i]
  rev = str[i] + rev
}

It'll look like this just with a whileloop because LinkedList has no indexed thing
when have two temp variables compare
if they equal return true 
if not false
